- class template Array: (contains elements of type T)
	* constructors :
				|> no parameter: 		    > Creates an empty array

				|> int (n) as a parameter:  > Creates an array of (n) elements initialized by default.
										    > Tip: Try to compile int * a = new int(); then display *a.

				|> Construction by copy and assignment operator :
										    > In both cases, modifying either the original array or its copy after copying musn’t affect the other array.
				
				|> the operator new[] to allocate memory ((allocating memory in advance) is forbidden)
											> Your program must never access nonallocated memory
				
				|> Elements can be accessed through the subscript operator: [ ].

				|> When accessing an element with the [ ] operator, if its index is out of bounds, an
																									std::exception is thrown

				|> function size() :
									> returns the number of elements in the array 
									> musn’t modify the current instance.
