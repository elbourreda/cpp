// EX02

	-  Implement a Base class that has a public virtual destructor only

	-  Create three empty :  that publicly inherit from Base
			* classes A, B and C, 

	- Implement the following functions:
		* Base * generate(void);
			- returns randomly one of them as a Base pointer

		* void identify(Base* p);
			- It prints the actual type of the object pointed to by p: "A", "B" or "C"
		
		* void identify(Base& p);
			- It prints the actual type of the object pointed to by p: "A", "B" or "C"
			- Using a pointer inside this function is forbidden.
	
	- Including the typeinfo header is forbidden.

	- Write a program to test that everything works as expected.
