// TODO LIST

- Bureaucrat Class
	*  Name  => string const
	*  Grade => int (1 -> 150)  ====> 1 the highest | 150 the lowest,
	*  getName()
	*  getGrade()

-  invalid grade =>  throw an exception :
						> Bureaucrat::GradeTooHighException
						> Bureaucrat::GradeTooLowException.

	*  functions to increment the bureaucrat grade   \    If the grade is out of range => throw the same exceptions as the constructor.
	*  functions to decrement the bureaucrat grade   /    If the grade is out of range => throw the same exceptions as the constructor.
			-> NOTE : (n = 3) increment(n) = 2; 
					  (n = 3) decrement(n) = 4; 

- The thrown exceptions must be catchable using try and catch blocks:
		try
		{
		/* do some stuff with bureaucrats */
		}
		catch (std::exception & e)
		{
		/* handle exception */
		}


- overload of the insertion (<<):
	OUTPUT =>>  " <name>, bureaucrat grade <grade>. "


***  turn in some tests to prove everything works as expected
