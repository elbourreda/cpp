	|- the base class {Form} ==> abstract class
V	|		* all form’s attributes ==> private (in the base class)
V	|		* execute(Bureaucrat const & executor) const ==> 
V	|			* to execute the form’s action
V	|				if 
V	|					* check that the form is signed
	|					* the grade of the bureaucrat attempting to execute the form is high enough
	|				else
	|					* Otherwise, throw an appropriate exception
	|				
V	|				call another function inside to execute the form:
V	|						* this function most be a pure virtual function
V	|						* implement it in the derived class of the form
V	|						* check if the requirements is enogh to exec the form -> execute()
	|						* throw exep if not
						


V	|- class ShrubberyCreationForm : public form
V	|		* (string) target => take from constructor
V	|		* (int) sing = 145
V	|		* (int) exec = 137
	|		* Create a file <target>_shrubbery in the working directory, and writes ASCII trees inside it


- RobotomyRequestForm : public form
		* (string) target => take from constructor
		* (int) sing = 72
		* (int) exec = 45
		* Makes some drilling noises. Then, informs that <target> has been robotomized successfully 50% of the time. Otherwise, informs that the robotomy failed.

- PresidentialPardonForm : public form
		* (string) target => take from constructor
		* (int) sing = 25
		* (int) exec = 5
		* Informs that <target> has been pardoned by Zaphod Beeblebrox.



 


 - class bureaucrat
		-  executeForm(Form const & form):
				* It must attempt to execute the form ==> 
						> If it’s successful,    " <bureaucrat> executed <form> "
						> If is not,             "print an explicit error message"


- Implement and turn in some tests to ensure everything works as expected.





* Whether you want to check the requirements in every concrete class or in the base class

(then call another function to execute the form) is up to you. 


However, one way is prettier than the other one.
